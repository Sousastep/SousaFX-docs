Max or Plugin Selector
======================

Many effects in SousaFX are presented in a way 
that lets you choose between a max-native effect 
or an external audio plugin.

To choose, first turn off the audio engine by clicking the power button in the :ref:`main window <Main Window>`. Then click the effect's main menu to select Max or Plugin, and turn the audio engine back on. Your choice is auto-saved.
