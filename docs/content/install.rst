============

First, please read the :ref:`End User License Agreement<End User License Agreement For SousaFX>`.

|

Install SousaFX & SousaVFX
--------------------------

1. `Download Max <https://cycling74.com/downloads>`_ from Cycling '74. 

2. Open Max, go to ``Menubar > Max > Preferences...``, and set the following preferences:

    - Interface > Restore Windows on Launch [uncheck]

    - Mixer > Enable Mixer Parallel Processing [check]

3. Open Max's Package Manager: ``Menubar > File > Show Package Manager``, and install the following packages:

    - `ease <c74max://packagemanager/ease>`_

    - `link <c74max://packagemanager/link>`_

    - `RNBO Synth Building Blocks <c74max://packagemanager/RNBO%20Synth%20Building%20Blocks>`_

    - `ISF <c74max://packagemanager/ISF>`_

    - `zero <c74max://packagemanager/zero>`_

    - `CNMAT Externals <c74max://packagemanager/CNMAT%20Externals>`_

    - `XRAY <c74max://packagemanager/XRAY>`_

4. `Download sousastep-0.9.3 <https://github.com/Sousastep/sousastep/releases/latest>`_ to your ``~/Documents/​Max 8/​Projects/`` folder. It contains SousaFX, SousaVFX, and SousaPlayback. 

5. Rename ``sousastep-0.9.3`` to ``sousastep``.

.. note:: If you're familiar with `git <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git>`_ then cloning the repo to your Projects folder is recommended.

6. Add ``/sousastep/`` to Max's global search path: Go to ``Menubar > Options... > File Preferences...``, "Add Path" +, "choose", and select ``~/Documents/​Max 8/​Project/​sousastep``.

.. important::

    When updating to new versions of SousaFX, 
    copy all files from ``~/Documents/​Max 8/​Projects/​sousastep/​SousaFX/​data/`` 
    to the new version's 
    ``sousastep/​SousaFX/​data/`` 
    folder to ensure that user presets are carried over. If you clone the repo with git, this isn't necessary.

.. note::

    SousaFX remains fully operational after Max's `30 day trial ends <https://support.cycling74.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049995834-Max-8-Max-7-Authorization#link-2>`_ thanks to Max not disabling `pattrstorage <https://docs.cycling74.com/max8/refpages/pattrstorage>`_. 🙏

Install SousaPlayback
---------------------

7. To open the SousaPlayback Project, `download Live Suite <https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/>`_ from Ableton.

    Open Live, open its settings ``Menubar > Live > Settings...``, and set the following:

    a. Audio > Audio Device [select your audio interface]

    b. Audio > In/Out Sample Rate [48000]

    c. Audio > Buffer Size [256]

    d. File Folder > Max Application > browse for ``/Applications/Max.app``

    f. Link Tempo MIDI > Show Link Toggle [show]


.. note::

    The SousaPlayback template project will not work after Ableton Live's `free trial <https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/>`_ ends. The template uses Max for live devices that require Ableton Live 11/12 Suite or Standard with the Max for Live addon.

.. _blackoctopus:

8. Optionally, download Black Octopus Sound's `excellent free samples <https://blackoctopus-sound.com/product/free-1gb-of-black-octopus-samples/>`_ and place `Black Octopus Sound - Free Samples Bundle` into ``~/Documents/​Max 8/​Projects/​sousastep/​SousaFX/​default/​SousaPlayback template Project/​Clips/``, or skip this step and use your own drum samples.
