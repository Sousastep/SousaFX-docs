SousaFX Main Window
===================

This window displays SousaFX's signalflow.

On the top-left is the audio engine's on/off button, next to the CPU meter. Below that is SousaFX's version number, which will brighten if there's an update available.

On the top-right are the main presets, which save the FX Bank's slot selection, bleed amount, modulation parameters, and preset description.

.. important:: Click the power button on the bottom-right of SousaFX to quit more gracefully. SousaFX saves some settings on shutdown, but this sometimes fails when closing the SousaFX window or quitting Max.
