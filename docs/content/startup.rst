ðŸš‚ Startup
==========

1. Open `~/Documents/Max 8/Projects/sousastep/SousaFX/SousaFX.maxproj`. SousaFX's Startup Preferences window will appear. Select your preferred audio interface, then uncheck the pause button. SousaFX will load momentarily.

.. note::

	The rig choices include SousaFX, which is the main rig, BasicFX, which is just a compressor and distortion effect, and VFX, which you'll only need if you've followed my tutorial on [how to build an LED sousaphone bell](https://jbaylies.github.io/Electrobrass_Encyclopedia/en/master/content/tutorials/LED-sousa-bell.html).
