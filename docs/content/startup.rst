Select your preferred audio interface, then uncheck the pause button. :ref:`SousaFX will appear momentarily <SousaFX Main Window>`. It takes a couple minutes to boot, but while it does, you may ponder a randomly selected prompt from :ref:`"Do It (Home)", or "Prompts for Programmers" <SousaFX Media>`.

.. note::

	The rig choices include SousaFX, which is the main rig, BasicFX, which is just a compressor and distortion effect, and VFX, which you'll only need if you've made an `LED sousaphone bell <https://jbaylies.github.io/Electrobrass_Encyclopedia/en/master/content/tutorials/LED-sousa-bell.html>`_.
