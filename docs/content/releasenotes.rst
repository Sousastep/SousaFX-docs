Known Bugs
----------

.. note:: 
	
	Feel free to submit bug reports or feature requests to `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/Sousastep/sousastep/issues>`_

- plugin selectors can only clear plugin slot by manually deleting json file in data folder.

- the About window shows "0 0" as install date on first boot.

- four rnbo filterdelays can't load at once, but three can. So if delay send 4 is bypassed, which it is by default, it will insta-feedback when opened, so no bindings are connected to it by default.

- :ref:`Param Control Logic's <Parameter Control Logic>` "This control is mapped to the joystick" message is only correct on load and won't update when switching presets. It will update when manually adding and removing connections.
