Delay and Reverb Sends
======================

The main input, and the loopers, share the four delay sends.

The delay routing is inspired by `dub <https://youtu.be/nA8OBQMt9WY>`_. When delay sends are mapped to joysticks, a positive feedback loop can occur. If the delay send is mapped to a button then there's no feedback loop. Thus, the delay effect itself should have a short feedback amount if it's mapped to a joystick, and a long feedback amount if it's mapped to a button.

The reverb send is only for the Main Input as a standard send, post-delays.



:swirl symbol:

	Allows one delay to be sent into another when they're mapped to a joystick by combining the four delay sends' stereo outputs into one stereo signal for the feedback loop

:max send:

	When delay sends are mapped to joysticks, the feedback loop is allowed to be slightly positive, which can increase the feedback over time. The "max send" parameter sets how slight that positive potential is.
